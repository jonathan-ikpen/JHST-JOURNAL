	<h2>About the Journal</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fountain Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences (FUJNAS), the official journal of the College of Natural and Applied Sciences at Fountain University, Osogbo, Nigeria, is dedicated to publishing high-quality, peer-reviewed, and hypothesis-driven original research across all disciplines of natural and applied sciences. FUJNAS provides an inclusive platform for innovative research from diverse pure and applied sciences fields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception in 2012, Fountain Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences (FUJNAS) has been recognised for its commitment to academic excellence. FUJNAS is indexed and abstracted by Scopus,&nbsp; Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ),&nbsp; Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International (CABI), Chemical Abstract Services (CAS), Google Scholar, and MIAR. The journal is currently applying for inclusion in Clarivate (Web of Science) and PubMed</span></p>
<h2>Open Access Policy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This journal ensures immediate open access to its content, embracing the principle that freely available research fosters a broader global knowledge exchange. Authors retain full copyright over their work while granting first publication rights to the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fountain Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (FUJNAS). All articles in FUJNAS are published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0), allowing for unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction, provided proper credit is given to the original authors and source.</span></p>
<h2>Publication Schedule</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FUJNAS publishes two issues per year and ensures that manuscripts are made available online as soon as they are accepted.</span></p>
<h2>Editorial Policy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors must prepare their manuscripts following the Instructions for Authors of the journal. Manuscripts that do not follow the format and style of the journal may be returned to the authors for revision or rejected. The Journal reserves the right to make any further formal changes and language corrections necessary in a manuscript accepted for publication. Manuscripts are accepted with the understanding that the authors have not violated the ethics of research and publishing during the conduct of the experiment and writing of the manuscript.</span></p>
<h2>General Requirements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All submitted manuscripts should contain original research written in the English Language, not previously published and not under consideration for publication elsewhere. Manuscripts may be submitted for consideration as original papers (research articles describing original experimental results) and short communications. The Journal also publishes mini-reviews, which are by invitation. However, authors willing to submit a review article may write a proposal for the editor-in-chief.</span></p>
<h2>Manuscript Preparation</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The manuscript (including references, tables, boxes, and legends) must be typed in 11-point Aptos, double-spaced on A4 paper with margins of 1 inch or 4.5 cm on all sides. All pages in the manuscript should be page-numbered.</span></p>
<h2>Cover letter</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cover letter must clearly show the full contact details with the corresponding author's postal address (es), phone numbers and e-mail address (es). The relevance of the study should also be indicated. The cover letter must also disclose all possible conflicts of interest (e.g. funding sources for consultancies or studies of products). A minimum of three (3) potential reviewers with their email addresses and institutions familiar with the subject matter should be suggested. However, the use of the reviewers is at the discretion of the Editor-in-Chief.</span></p>
<h2>Title page</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title page should contain the title of the manuscript, the authors’ names, affiliations and email addresses. One of the authors should be designated as the corresponding author.</span></p>
<h2>Title</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This should be in the title case and devoid of syntax problems. The title should be concise and represent the scope and content of the study.</span></p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstract should not be more than 250 words, containing a concise summary of the objective and scope, general methods, results, conclusion and significance of the research.</span></p>
<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The journal welcomes a maximum of six keywords, which should be words that can be used to retrieve the paper, not general words. Words appearing in the title should not be given as keywords. The keywords must correspond with those in Medical Subject Headings (MESH).</span></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Introduction should provide sufficient background on the study. It should also give the statement of the problem and the rationale for conducting the research. The aim should also be clearly defined. The contribution to the area of study should be identified. All these must be presented in logical manner.</p>
<h2>Materials and Methods</h2>
<p>This section must provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Methods already published should be indicated by reference, and only relevant modifications should be described. Newly developed methods should also be described in detail. The sources of all major instruments, chemicals, reagents, assay kits and drugs must be given. The type of statistical tool(s) used to analyse the data should be mentioned and justified. All procedures involving experimental animals or human subjects must be accompanied by a statement on ethical approval from an appropriate ethics committee.</p>
<h2>Result and Discussion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors may wish to combine the two sections (Results and Discussion)</span></p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A clear and concise Results Section should highlight the important results obtained. Data should be organised into Figures and Tables. The same results should not be repeated in Figures and Tables. All Tables and Figures should be appropriately referred to within the text. Values already contained in the Tables need not be repeated in the Results Section. Qualitative as well as quantitative results should be included if applicable.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This section should relate the Results Section to the current understanding of the scientific problems being investigated in the field. This section, apart from adducing scientific reason(s) to the results obtained, must also present the theoretical implications and practical applications of the findings. The authors should also identify where their findings agree and/or contrast with previously published studies. Reasons for such differences must also be advanced. This section must also be devoid of speculations that are not supported by findings in their present study. Results and Discussion may also be merged into a single Section.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conclusion must reflect the judgment or decision reached by reasoning after the discussion on the manuscript. This section sums up the arguments about what you have been writing about.</span></p>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major contributors who did not qualify as authors should be acknowledged accordingly. Funding sources should also be acknowledged appropriately.</span></p>
<h2>Conflict(s) of Interests</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authors are required to disclose financial interests (e.g. employment, significant share ownership, patent rights, consultancy, research funding, etc.) in any company or institution that might benefit from their publication. All authors must provide details of any other potential competing interests of a personal nature that readers or editors might consider relevant to their publication. To prevent ambiguity, authors must state explicitly whether potential conflicts exist or do not exist. The statement should be placed in the text of the submitted manuscript directly following the Acknowledgements.</span></p>
<h2>References</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All references must be listed at the end of the paper, and authors are responsible for ensuring their accuracy. References should be complete and formatted according to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_system"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vancouver Reference Format</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as outlined below:</span></p>
<p><strong>In-Text Reference</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text – they are identified by Arabic numerals in parentheses (1), square brackets [1], superscript<sup>1</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or a combination</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><sup>[1]</sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The number usually appears at the end of the material it supports, and an entry in the reference list would give full bibliographical information for the source:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood loss and the number of patients requiring post-operative blood transfusions were significantly greater, but operation and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter, for the DHS versus the PFNA group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1]</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
