<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Statement of Human and Animal Rights</strong></h3>
<p>When reporting experiments on human subjects, authors should indicate whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. If doubt exists whether the research was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, the authors must explain the rationale for their approach, and demonstrate that the institutional review body explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of the study. When reporting experiments on animals, authors should be asked to indicate whether the institutional and national guide for the care and use of laboratory animals was followed.</p>
<p>Authors of manuscripts that describe experimental studies on either humans or animals must supply a statement that the study was approved by an institutional review committee or ethics committee and that the subjects gave informed consent. Such approval should be described in the Methods section of the manuscript. In addition, for studies conducted with human subjects, the method by which informed consent was obtained from the participants (i.e., verbal or written) also needs to be stated in the Methods section.</p>
<ul>
<li>For studies with human subjects, please include the following sentence:</li>
</ul>
<p>All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with <a href="https://www.wma.net/what-we-do/medical-ethics/declaration-of-helsinki/doh-oct1975/">the Helsinki Declaration of 1975</a>, as revised in 2008 (5). Informed consent was obtained from all patients to be included in the study.</p>
<p>If doubt exists whether the research was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, the authors must explain the rationale for their approach, and demonstrate that the institutional review body explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of the study.</p>
<ul>
<li>If any identifying information about patients is included in the article, the following sentence should also be included:</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional informed consent was obtained from all patients for which identifying information is included in this article.</p>
<ul>
<li>For studies with animals, please include the following sentence:</li>
</ul>
<p>All institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed.</p>
<ul>
<li>For articles that do not contain studies with human or animal subjects:</li>
</ul>
<p>This article does not contain any studies with human or animal subjects.</p>
<h3><strong>Research involving human participants, their data or biological material</strong></h3>
<h4>Ethics approval</h4>
<p>When reporting a study that involved human participants, their data or biological material, authors should include a statement that confirms that the study was approved (or granted exemption) by the appropriate institutional and/or national research ethics committee (including the name of the ethics committee) and certify that the study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/">1964 Declaration of Helsinki</a> and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. If doubt exists whether the research was conducted in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration or comparable standards, the authors must explain the reasons for their approach, and demonstrate that an independent ethics committee or institutional review board explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of the study. If a study was granted an exemption from requiring ethics approval, this should also be detailed in the manuscript (including the reasons for the exemption).</p>
<h4>Retrospective ethics approval</h4>
<p>If a study has not been granted ethics committee approval prior to commencing, retrospective ethics approval usually cannot be obtained and it may not be possible to consider the manuscript for peer review. The decision on whether to proceed to peer review in such cases is at the Editor's discretion.</p>
<h4>Ethics approval for retrospective studies</h4>
<p>Although retrospective studies are conducted on already available data or biological material (for which formal consent may not be needed or is difficult to obtain) ethics approval may be required depending on the law and the national ethical guidelines of a country. Authors should check with their institution to make sure they are complying with the specific requirements of their country.</p>
<h4>Ethics approval for case studies</h4>
<p>Case reports require ethics approval. Most institutions will have specific policies on this subject. Authors should check with their institution to make sure they are complying with the specific requirements of their institution and seek ethics approval where needed. Authors should be aware to secure informed consent from the individual (or parent or guardian if the participant is a minor or incapable).</p>
<h4>Cell lines</h4>
<p>If human cells are used, authors must declare in the manuscript: what cell lines were used by describing the source of the cell line, including when and from where it was obtained, whether the cell line has recently been authenticated and by what method.</p>
<p>If cells were bought from a life science company the following need to be given in the manuscript: name of the company (that provided the cells), cell type, number of the cell lines, and batch of cells.</p>
<p>It is recommended that authors check the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/?term=cell%20line%20status%20misidentified%5bAttribute%5d">NCBI database</a>&nbsp;for misidentification and contamination of human cell lines. This step will alert authors to possible problems with the cell line and may save considerable time and effort.</p>
<p>Further information is available from the&nbsp;<a href="http://iclac.org/about-iclac/">International Cell Line Authentication Committee</a>&nbsp;(ICLAC).</p>
<p>Authors should include a statement that confirms that an institutional or independent ethics committee (including the name of the ethics committee) approved the study and that informed consent was obtained from the donor or next of kin.</p>
<h4>Research Resource Identifiers (RRID)</h4>
<p>Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) are persistent unique identifiers (effectively similar to a DOI) for research resources. This journal encourages authors to adopt RRIDs when reporting key biological resources (antibodies, cell lines, model organisms and tools) in their manuscripts.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Organism:&nbsp;</strong><em>Filip1<sup>tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi</sup></em>&nbsp;<strong>RRID:MMRRC_055641-UCD</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cell Line:</strong>&nbsp;RST307 cell line&nbsp;<strong>RRID:CVCL_C321</strong></p>
<p><strong>Antibody:</strong>&nbsp;Luciferase antibody DSHB Cat# LUC-3,&nbsp;<strong>RRID: AB_2722109</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plasmid:</strong>&nbsp;mRuby3 plasmid&nbsp;<strong>RRID:Addgene_104005</strong></p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong>&nbsp;ImageJ Version 1.2.4&nbsp;<strong>RRID: SCR_003070</strong></p>
<p>RRIDs are provided by the&nbsp;<a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources">Resource Identification Portal</a>. Many commonly used research resources already have designated RRIDs. The portal also provides authors links so that they can quickly&nbsp;<a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources/about/resource">register a new resource</a>&nbsp;and obtain an RRID.</p>
<h4>Clinical Trial Registration</h4>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) definition of a clinical trial is "<em>any research study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes</em>". The WHO defines health interventions as “<em>A health intervention is an act performed for, with or on behalf of a person or population whose purpose is to assess, improve, maintain, promote or modify health, functioning or health conditions</em>” and a health-related outcome is generally defined as a change in the health of a person or population as a result of an intervention.</p>
<p>To ensure the integrity of the reporting of patient-centred trials, authors must register prospective clinical trials (phase II to IV trials) in suitable publicly available repositories. For example <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>&nbsp;or any of the primary registries that participate in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform">WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform</a>.</p>
<p>The trial registration number (TRN) and date of registration should be included as the last line of the manuscript abstract.</p>
<p>For clinical trials that have not been registered prospectively, authors are encouraged to register retrospectively to ensure the complete publication of all results. The trial registration number (TRN), date of registration and the words 'retrospectively registered’ should be included as the last line of the manuscript abstract.</p>
<h4>Standards of reporting</h4>
<p>Springer Nature advocates complete and transparent reporting of biomedical and biological research and research with biological applications. Authors are recommended to adhere to the minimum reporting guidelines hosted by the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.equator-network.org/">EQUATOR Network</a>&nbsp;when preparing their manuscript.</p>

<h3><strong>Procedures for Dealing with Unethical Behavior</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Identification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unethical behaviour can be identified and reported to journal editors and/or the publisher of Fountain Journals (FJ) at any time.</li>
<li>Unethical practices may include but are not limited to, violations of any of the above-mentioned Ethical Expectations (e.g., plagiarism, falsification or fabrication, authorship falsification, redundant publication, undeclared conflict of interest, etc.).</li>
<li>For an investigation to be conducted, the person reporting the ethical breach must provide sufficient evidence. Until a conclusion is reached, all allegations are treated equally and seriously.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investigation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The journal's editor will investigate in consultation with FJ. In the case of allegations against a journal editor, the investigation will be conducted in consultation with FJ by a different member of the journal's editorial board, such as a deputy editor. The investigation into allegations against FJ will be conducted by the journal's editor in consultation with other members of the journal's editorial board.</li>
<li>To avoid defamation, evidence gathering will be done so that allegations are only shared with those who need to know.</li>
<li>The investigation will be completed within a reasonable time after the allegation is made (s).</li>
<li>The accused party will be notified and allowed to respond to the allegation as part of the investigation (s).</li>
<li>If the allegation(s) are valid as part of the investigation, the severity of the breach will be determined.</li>
<li>Cases beyond the editor's and FJ's investigative capabilities (e.g., data fabrication or theft) will be referred to the author's institution with a request for an investigation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor Ethical Violations</strong></p>
<p>The journal's editor and FJ will handle minor infractions.</p>
<p><strong>Major Ethical Violations</strong></p>
<p>In cases of serious misconduct, the accused's employer may be required to be notified. In consultation with FJ, the editorial board, and/or the society governing body, the editor will decide whether this is warranted.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences</strong></p>
<p>When an ethical violation is confirmed, one or more of the following actions will be taken.</p>
<ul>
<li>Informing the author or reviewer of the misconduct breach in cases where there appears to be a misunderstanding of ethical standards;</li>
<li>Sending a strongly worded letter to the author or reviewer outlining the breach and warning against future behaviour</li>
<li>Publishing an erratum notice outlining the ethical breach</li>
<li>Sending a formal letter to the author's or reviewer's employer or funding agency;</li>
<li>Undertaking a formal retraction or withdrawal of the work in question from the journal, as well as informing indexing services and readers of the misconduct;</li>
<li>Imposing a formal embargo on submissions from an individual for a fixed period; and</li>
<li>Reporting the misconduct to a regulatory association for review and action.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conflict of Interest</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All authors must disclose any commercial associations or other arrangements (e.g., financial compensation received, patient-licensing arrangements, the potential for profit, consultancy, stock ownership, etc.) that may pose a conflict of interest in connection with the article.</li>
<li>Editors and reviewers must recuse themselves from evaluating papers in which they may have a conflict of interest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appeals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Authors have the right to appeal decisions. All appeals will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by journal editors. The journal editors will recuse themselves depending on the nature of the appeal, and the appeal will be reviewed by a different member of the journal's editorial team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Corrections</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Authors must notify the journal's editor and FJ of any factual errors they discover or are informed of in a published article. When corrections are required, they are made quickly and are accompanied by an errata notice that describes the correction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retractions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The editors consider retractions when there is evidence of untrustworthy data or findings, plagiarism, duplicate publication, or unethical research. If an article is under investigation, we may consider an expression of concern notice. If it is determined that a retraction is required, a retraction notice will be added, along with an explanation of the retraction and the original article metadata. The original text will still be available.</li>
<li>In exceptional circumstances, the original article may be removed for legal reasons. In such cases, the metadata will be kept, while the original text will be replaced with the retraction note and a note explaining why the article was removed for legal reasons.</li>
