					<p>Game-based learning among Nigerian secondary schools is not common. In foreign countries where game-based learning is widely used, it is often believed that it could be more distracting and may not align with learning goals. Considering this stance, it is imperative to investigate among teachers and students if this approach would be effective for teaching computer studies before it could be recommended for implementation. Thus, the need for this study which investigated students and teachers’ perception on game-based learning for effective teaching of computer studies in secondary schools, Ilorin. Specifically, the study investigated secondary school teachers and students’ awareness of game-based learning, their attitude to game-based learning and their readiness toward game-based learning for effective teaching. It also examined the respondents’ perception toward the usefulness of game-based learning for effective teaching. The researcher demonstrated the use of game-based learning with the teaching of Network Routing by playing the orange game as found on CS unplugged. This is to ensure that both teachers and students understand the concept of game-based learning before attempting the survey. This study adopted a descriptive research using a survey method.
