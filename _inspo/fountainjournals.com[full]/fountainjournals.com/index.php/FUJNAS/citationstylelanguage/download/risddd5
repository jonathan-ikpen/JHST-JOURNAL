AB  - The effects of organic nitrogen, sucrose and starch on the bio-methanation of rice bran were investigated using digesters of 1-litre capacity operated at ambient temperature (30- 32oC) and pH of 7 for 20 days. Rice bran and organic nitrogen supplement were varied at ratios 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1, while 20g of sucrose and 20 g of starch were added to rice bran as supplements. Fresh strained cow rumen liquor was used as inoculum. There was no significant difference (P0.05). Varying the organic nitrogen had no significant effect on the biogas yield (P
