Abstract   HIV/AIDS is a fatal illness that weakens the immune system of the body, making the victim susceptible to several opportunistic infections. The analysis and numerical simulation of the proposed epidemic model of HIV/AIDS with vertical transmission was carried out. The disease free and endemic equilibrium of the model were obtained and the basic reproduction number was established. Numerical simulations using the homotropy perturbation method was employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the key findings. The results of the simulation were graphically presented and interpreted.   Keywords: HIV/AIDS, disease free equilibrium, endemic equilibrium, Laplace Adomian decomposition
