Zakat and Sadaqah are primary forms of charity in Islam meant to help the poor and needy. However, the collection and distribution of these forms of charity can be beset by challenges. The challenges include inadequate infrastructure for collecting and disbursing funds, a lack of transparency and accountability, corruption, and cultural and social barriers to giving. The study argues that addressing these challenges requires a technological approach that involves implementing forms for collecting and distributing Zakat and Sadaqah using WordPress core files. The study’s key objective is to ensure transparency, accountability and avoid the corrupt practice of multi-collection of Zakat and Sadaqah funds using digital platforms to collect, manage, and distribute zakat, which is very useful because it provides much convenience for its users. Therefore, the study presents a technological (software) solution to some challenges that Zakat and Sadaqah institutions face while collecting and distributing Zakat and Sadaqah using an existing content management system (WordPress) core architecture. In achieving this, we used the Design Thinking method. The design process adopted the Agile software design steps in the implementation of the system. The study resulted to revolutionized management of zakat funds and created a more efficient and accountable ecosystem for the collection and distribution of Zakat in Ibadan.
