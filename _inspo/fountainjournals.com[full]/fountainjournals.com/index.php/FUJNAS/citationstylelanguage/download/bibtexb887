Hypoglycaemic potentials of aqueous root extract of Jatropha curcas (250 and 450 mg/kg body weight of rats) was investigated in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Effect of the extract on some haematological parameters was also investigated. Thirty albino rats (Rattus norvegicus) of mean weight 165.0 ± 2.50 g were randomly selected into normal and diabetic groups, each with six rats. Diabetic treated rats were placed on 14.2 mg/kg body weight glucophage (reference drug), 250 mg/kg and 450 mg/kg body weight of extract. All treatments were administered orally, once daily for fifteen days. The blood glucose levels were monitored and the haematological parameters like haemoglobin (Hgb), red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, packed cell volume (PCV), percentage lymphocytes (LYM) and neutrophils (NEUT) were also analyzed. A significant (p<0.05) reduction in fasting Blood Glucose Levels (BGL) was observed in alloxan-induced diabetic rats treated with the extract. There was a significant (p<0.05) reduction in Hgb, PCV, RBC and WBC and its differentials of the diabetic untreated rats while administration of glucophage, 250 and 450 mg/kg body weight of the aqueous extract (Jc250 and Jc450) to diabetic rats significantly (p<0.05) increase all these parameters. These results suggested that the aqueous root extract of Jatropha curcas possesses hypoglycaemic activity and also improved the aberrations in the blood parameters of alloxan-induced diabetic rat.
