AB  - Authentication is a method that verifies that users or systems are who they claim to be, based on identity of any form. Smart devices are often lost or stolen; password could be easily detected or hacked. Most of the new model smart devices have inbuilt security for authentication which most times do not work perfectly. For that purpose, high level of authentication for smart devices is needed. The need to ensure security of information on these devices is highly necessary and at the same time difficult. This work developed an enhanced authentication system for android based mobile devices to increase the security level and confidentiality of its information which enables user-friendliness environment. It combines face recognition methods with pin or pattern which makes it more robust and reliable in securing our mobile devices. The implementation was done using Schulz Android Studio SDK and developed with the following programming languages: JavaScript, XML (Extensible Markup Language), OpenCV, and Java. The developed application can be installed and work on any mobile device with the latest android operating system and its backward compatible. The system was tested on different smart devices from different vendors and its efficiency is above 90%. Evaluating the application with some existing systems was done in order to ascertain the reliability of the solution and strengthen it. The system tagged MULTILOCK enables users to register more than one user, and gain access to the device with either pin or pattern together with a registered faces.Keywords: Face detection, Security, Mobile devices, Confidentiality, Pin, Pattern
