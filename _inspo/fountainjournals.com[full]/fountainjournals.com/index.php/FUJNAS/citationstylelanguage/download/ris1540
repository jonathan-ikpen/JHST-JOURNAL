AB  - Plant products provide a vast source of therapeutics, but not without toxicity. This study evaluated the in vitro cytotoxic and proliferative activity of selected plant extracts on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The PBMCs from healthy donors were exposed to varying concentrations (25 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, 100 µg/ml and 200 µg/ml) of aqueous extracts of young leaves of Mangifera indica (MI) and stem barks of Commiphora kerstingii (CK), and Lannea acida and Acacia sieberiana formulation (LAASF). Trypan blue assay was used to determine the viability of human PBMCs after isolation. Cytotoxicity and proliferation of PBMCs were determined using WST-8 assay. The total viable cell count of the isolated PBMCs in this study was 8000 x 104 cells/ml while viability was 96.15%. The extract of LAASF showed the lowest percentage cytotoxicity (2.63%) at 25 µg/ml concentration, followed by CK (2.70%), then MI (7.71%). There was significant decrease in PBMCs mean absorbance scores across the different concentrations of MI (p=0.008), CK (p
