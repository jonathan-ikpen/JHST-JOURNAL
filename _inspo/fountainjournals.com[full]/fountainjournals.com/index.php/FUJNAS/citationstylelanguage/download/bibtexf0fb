A lot of abnormalities occur in real-life scenarios, thus leading to some difficulties in modelling such scenarios without a deeper understanding of certain aspects of Lévy processes. In this paper, the short rate model of Hull-White (1990) is extended to a model for capturing possibilities of jumps in real-life situations using a class of Lévy processes called a variance gamma process.
