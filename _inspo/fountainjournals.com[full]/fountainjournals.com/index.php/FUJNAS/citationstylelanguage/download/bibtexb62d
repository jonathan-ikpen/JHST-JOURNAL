The presence of toxic elements in mining areas has always been a concern for public health worldwide. Previously conducted studies have mainly focused on separate soil or water contamination as routes to potentially toxic elements, conceivably underestimating residents’ risks. This study examined the health risks associated with the consumption of Abelmuscus esculentus planted in different sediment compositions; control soil + control water (CSCW), control soil + goldmine water (CSGW), goldmine sediment + control water (GSCW) and goldmine sediment + goldmine water (GSGW). As, Ni, Cr and Cd concentrations in goldmine water were found to be higher than allowable limits. After 21 days, A. esculentus seedlings planted on different soil/sediment compositions were harvested for the determination of elements using an inductively coupled plasma-optical electron spectrometer (ICP-OES). Estimated dietary intakes of minerals and toxic metals were lower than recommended limits. The non-carcinogenic risks posed by heavy metals are minimal, but A. esculentus in GSGW had 131.67 % greater risks of being hazardous. Carcinogenic risks indicate that A. esculentus grown in all soil/sediment compositions had the potential to cause cancer, with GSGW having approximately 63 % higher risks. Farming practices employing goldmine sediment and water present foreseeable hazards to health when not controlled going by findings in this study.          Keywords: Abelmuscus esculentus, Carcinogenic risk; Estimated dietary intake; Gold mining; Hazard ndex
