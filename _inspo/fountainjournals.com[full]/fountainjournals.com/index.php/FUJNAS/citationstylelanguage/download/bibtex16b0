Optimum plant population is very important in enhancing high and stable grain yield especially in quality protein maize (QPM) production. A field trial was therefore conducted to compare the performance of six hybrids (three each of QPM and normal endosperm) at three population densities using a split-plot design at the sub-station of the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority, Oke-Oyi, in the southern Guinea savanna zone of Nigeria during the 2010 and 2011 cropping seasons. Plant population -1 densities (53,333, 66,666, and 88,888 plants ha ) constituted the main plots and the six hybrids were assigned to the subplots, replicated three times. Our results showed a differential response of maize -1 hybrids to high densities, with plant populations above 53,333 plants ha reduced grain yield, and this is more pronounced in QPM than normal endosperm hybrids. This is contrary to the results observed in many other countries. This might be that the hybrids were selected in low yield potential area at low plant densities, and hence not tolerant to plant density stress. It may also be due to low yield potential of the experimental site, which does not allow yield increases at high plant densities. Though normal endosperm hybrids 0103-11 and 0103-15 as well as QPM Dada-ba were superior for grain yield among -1 the hybrids at 53,333 plants ha , hybrid 0103-11 was most outstanding. Therefore, genetic improvement of QPM and normal endosperm hybrids for superior stress tolerance and high yield could be enhanced by selection at higher plant population densities.
