Cervical Cancer (CC) remains one of the leading causes of death among reproductive-age females globally. Screening and vaccination of CC are still low among females, hence the increase in the death toll from the disease. This study investigated the factors influencing the uptake of cervical cancer screening and vaccination among reproductive-age female workers at selected hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria. Using a descriptive quantitative design, self-administered questionnaires were used to gather data from a total of 160 participants. The validity and reliability of the instrument were ensured with a Cronbach Alpha coefficient of 0.899. The collected data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics at p <0.05 significance level using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24.0. Good knowledge and poor attitudes about cervical cancer screening and vaccination were documented in this study. As reported in this study, identified factors influencing the uptake of CC screening include the cost of screening and vaccination, availability of service, economic status of the individual, and level of education. There was no significant relationship between the level of knowledge of cervical screening and vaccination and the uptake among the participants (p=0.178). Our study suggests that knowledge did not translate into the uptake of cervical cancer screening among study participants. Other factors were responsible. Therefore, multi-dimensional approaches toward addressing limiting factors to the uptake of cervical cancer screening and vaccination should be encouraged. Making screening facilities available and at a subsidised rate may encourage increased uptake. Continuous public health education and enlightenment are also recommended.
