AB  - Aflatoxin-B1 is a ubiquitous mycotoxin usually accumulated in food and feeds, thereby posing a critical health risk to humans and animals. This study was carried out to determine its effects on performance characteristics and haematoogy indicators of stress in male Sprague Dawley rats. The rats were randomly distributed into 4 groups (n=10 per group) including an unexposed group that served as control and other groups which were orally exposed to 150 µg of aflatoxin-B1 per kg body weight on a varied basis for 28 days. The records of food intake and body weight changes were obtained while blood was collected at the end of the study for downstream analyses. There was a significant difference observed in food intake, body weight, kidney weight, liver weight, lung weight, and testes weight of the rats (p
