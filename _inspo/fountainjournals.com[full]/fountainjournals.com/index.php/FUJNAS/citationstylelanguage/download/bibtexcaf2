Ethanol, methanol and aqueous extracts of the leaves of Bryophyllum pinnatum obtained through cold maceration, were screened for their antibacterial activities against selected multi-drug resistant bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi Staphylococcus aureus) using the agar well diffusion method. Broth dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the extracts at concentrations ranging from 100mg/ml to 25mg/ml. The ethanol extract was the most reactive while the aqueous extract showed lesser antibacterial activity. Ofloxacin was the most effective antibiotic in the antibiotic susceptibility profiling of the test organisms. It was however evident that the ethanol extract of Bryophyllum pinnatum has higher antibacterial efficacy on the test organisms than Ofloxacin. Bacteriostatic and -cidal activities were exhibited by the plant extracts against the organisms ranging from 25 – 100 × 103 μg/ml. Succinctly, Bryophyllum pinnatum possesses biologically active constituents with explorable pharmacological potentials.
