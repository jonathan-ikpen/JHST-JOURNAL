AB  - Dielectric and optical dispersion properties of thin films of SnO2 deposited via spray pyrolysis were investigated. These properties are fundamental to new applications of SnO2 in energy storage and pressure sensing. The composition and thickness of the films were determined using the Rutherford Backscattered Spectroscopic mode of the Pelletron Tandem Accelerator. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to examine the crystal structure and surface morphology of the films. Optical transmission data were analyzed to obtain the optical band gap, dispersion parameters, and dielectric constants. The analyses showed that the films were polycrystalline in nature with the tetragonal rutile crystal structure. It was also observed that annealed films increased in thickness compared to the asdeposited samples. The Urbach tail width of the annealed sample also decresed from 293 to 252 meV indicating an improvement in crystallinity with heat treatment. The refractive index dispersion in the visible region analyzed in terms of long wavelength single-oscillator Sellmier approximation was in the range 1.9 -3.0. The zero and high-frequency dielectric constants were evaluated. The values of these constants could be a justification for further exploration of SnO2-based materials for charge storage and capacitive pressure sensing.Keywords: pyrolysis, dielectric, refractive index, thin films
