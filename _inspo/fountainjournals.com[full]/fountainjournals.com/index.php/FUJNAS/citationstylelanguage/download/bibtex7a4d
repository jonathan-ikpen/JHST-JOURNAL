The oxidative insult of 2, 2-dichlorovinyl-dimethyl phosphate (DDVP) in male rats brain was investigated. Rats were grouped into four: A, B, C and D where A, (the control) received orally 1 mL of distilled water; B, C and D (test groups) received orally 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight of DDVP respectively for 28 days. DDVP administration caused significant decrease (P<0.05) in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in the brain. Brain levels of glutathione (GSH), total thiol, vitamins C and E were also significantly reduced (P<0.05), while peroxide glutathione (GSSG) level increased significantly (P<0.05). Brain malonidialdehyde and lipid hydroperoxide also increased significantly (P<0.05) in all DDVP treated groups. The available data from this study revealed that DDVP brings about its toxicity through depletion of the antioxidant systems and thus exposing the cells and cellular macromolecules to oxidative assault by reactive oxygen species generated either from its metabolites or other in vivo means.  Keywords: 2, 2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate; redox homeostasis; enzymic antioxidant system; nonenzymic antioxidant system; lipid peroxidation.
