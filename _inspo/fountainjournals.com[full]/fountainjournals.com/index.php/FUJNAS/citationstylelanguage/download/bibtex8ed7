A Mathematical Model of HIV/AIDS with Heterosexual transmission in the presence of treatment was examine in this paper, it ascertained the impact of treated individuals on the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS. Equilibrium points of the model system were found, stability analysis and numerical simulation were carried out, it was discovered that HIV/AIDS can die out with test of time as Ro < 1 . It was observed that the model had a disease free equilibrium which was asymptotically stable for Ro < 1 and unstable for Ro > 1. Graphical representations of the numerical analysis showing the effect of treatment on the model were also presented. Keywords: HIV/AIDS, Heterosexual Transmission, ARVs, Compartmental model, Disease Free and Endemic equilibrium, Treatment, and Basic Reproductive Number
