AB  - The physicochemical properties with their distribution pattern and sources of sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) listed as priority pollutants were investigated in underground water, sediment and soil samples around "˜Awosuuru" dump-site in Osogbo Nigeria. The physicochemical parameters; degree of acidity (pH), total organic carbon (TOC), Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (BOD), in the samples were determined using standard methods. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively in the samples using gas chromatography coupled with flame ionisation detector (GC-FID). The values of pH and TOC ranged from 7.76 to 8.02 and 0.82 to 1.01 (wt%) in water; 7.70 to 8.34 and 0.35 to 1.17(wt%) in sediment; 8.03 to 8.56 and 0.51 to 1.05 (wt%) in soil respectively, BOD ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 (mg/L) and COD from 36.40 to 64.40 (mg/L) in water samples. The physicochemical parameters result showed that the samples have some amount of carbonates, biodegradable and oxidizable pollutants and organic matter reflecting pollution in the study area. The concentrations of PAHs recorded in the samples indicated moderate pollution. Various diagnostic PAHs ratios indicate pyrolytic source majorly from burning of refuse. Also, the health implication of the pollution status of the study area was discussed.Keywords: Dumpsites, GC- FID, PAHs, pollution, TOC
