Management of dead birds in poultry farms has been a major problem in Nigeria. This study aimed at using 2D resistivity tomography to outline leachate plume from disposal pits in a poultry farm. 2D electrical resistivity tomography were conducted along three profiles, two of which were 3.0 m and 25.0 m respectively to the two available mortality pits (Pit1 and Pit 2) while the third was 300.0 m away from the mortality Pit 1. Profile length of 100.0 m each and interspaced 5.0 m oriented in the North-East (Profile 1), South-East (Profile 2) and North-East (Profile 3) directions respectively was covered. 2D resistivity data inversions were performed on the obtained converted apparent resistivity using DIPROWIN software. Five water samples collected from five different hand dug wells available within the poultry farm were analysed for hydro chemical parameters. 2D results showed conductive paths occurrence in transverse one at the depth of 5.0 m, a horizontal distance of 45.0 m to 55.0 m, and had migrated down to the depth of 10.0 m. The second traverse showed varying resistivity values ranged 7.0 Ω m to 31.0 Ω m up to a depth of 15.0 m, an indication of the presence of clay soil. Low resistivity values ranged 14.0 Ω m to 49.0 Ω m were recorded in traverse 3. The extent of the contaminant is prominent at the topmost part of the soil and to almost 10.0 m depth. This was attributable to the contaminant from the deposit site of faeces of the poultry. Hydro chemical analysis indicated high values of Conductivity and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). This confirms the migration of leachate from the disposal pits to the surrounding soils and groundwater and the 2D results obtained from disposal Pit 1. Other alternative methods of disposing dead birds are hereby recommended. Keywords: Contamination; dead birds’ mortality pits; profile length; 2D resistivity tomography
