The use of distributed programming has become popular practice among software developers in the last few years. Although, quite a number of researchers has explored the domain but its implementation still poses a lots of problems. Similarly, adoption of the practice in the classroom is not left out as it required additional tools. In this report, I have assessed the use and acceptability of the distributed programming practices among students of computer science using an online questionnaire. The results showed that the level of awareness of distributed programing practice among the students of computer science is very low so also is that of the tools that facilitate it. Therefore introducing the practices into the curriculum of high institution of learning is highly recommended as this will strengthen the inter-university student collaboration.
