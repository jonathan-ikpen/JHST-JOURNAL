In group theory, given two groups G and H, it is possible to construct a new group from the Cartesian product of G and H, G × H. With this as a motivation, we replicate this concept in fuzzy group algebra. In this paper, we take a slight deviation from the familiar definition of fuzzy bigroup by looking at fuzzy bigroup from the idea of Cartesian product of groups. We define Cartesian fuzzy function on groups and give examples. We also define Cartesian fuzzy bigroup and study some of its basic properties. Keywords: Bigroups, Cartesian fuzzy function, Fuzzy bigroups.
