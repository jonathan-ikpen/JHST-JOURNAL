AB  - An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of feeding three species of Stylosanthes as supplements to a basal diet consisting of Cyonodon dactylon on the performance of West African dwarf sheep. The three treatments imposed were: Treatment 1, a basal diet consisting of poor quality grass (Cyondon dactylon) and Stylosanthes scabra in the ratio of 70:30. Treatment 2, the basal diet added with Stylosanthes guianensis (70:30); and Treatment 3,the basal diet with Stylosanthes hamata (70:30). The study lasted for 24 days, a 10 day adjustment period and a 14- day data collection, using 3 rams of comparable age and weight. Data were analyzed as a 3 x 3 Latin square. Animals supplemented with S. guianensis had the highest DM intake while S. scabra was least consumed by sheep (p
