AB  - Functionalization of polymers had gained attention because of advance applications as sensor, energy devices, membrane, etc. This present study is aimed at studying surface modification as a result of electrospinning functionalized polyethylene oxide (PEO) with zinc ion Zinc chloride was added in various proportions to PEO solution then electrospun at various voltage. Fibres resulted into various shapes; belt, rod, mat and thread which differs from the primary PEO. The mechanism for the morphology modification was studied and the optimum conditions which retain the fibrous morphology were noted. This functionalized PEO can be used as energy device.Keyword: Polyethylene oxide, Modification, Fibre, Composite, Functionalized
