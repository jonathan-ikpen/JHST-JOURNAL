AB  - This study examined the influence of microbial contamination on the antioxidant composition and free radical scavenging effects of fresh and decaying spices: Lycopersicon esculentum, Capsicum frutescens S, Capsicum frutescens T and Capsicum annum used by food vendors. Microbial load was enumerated with potato dextrose agar (PDA) using the pour plate technique, phytochemical components were determined using Folio-Ciocalteu, Aluminium chloride, acetone-hexane methods for phenolic, flavonoids and β-carotene & lycopene respectively while free radical scavenging capacity was determined using DPPH method. Decaying L. esculentum had highest microbial population of 7.14 X 105 cfu/g and fresh C. annum had the lowest microbial population of 0.72 X 101cfu/g. Microbial population in decaying spices were generally significantly higher than fresh spices. Aspergillus spp were found in all decaying spices and in fresh C. frutescens T. Microsporum spp were found in all fresh spices except in C. frutescens and T. Microsporum spp and in decaying spices except in C. annum. There were significant decreases (p
