In Nigeria, Grounding Systems Installation (GSI) were carried out without prior knowledge of Soil Apparent Resistivity (SAR) and Soil Moisture Content (SMC) of a location, which strongly influence its effective functioning when fault current builds up in the electrical circuit. Therefore, these two factors were measured in four locations: P(Latitude: 7°37`46.074 and Longitude: 4°12`2.250), Q(Latitude: 7°37`14.886 and Longitude: 4°11`10.608), R(Latitude: 7°37`26.964 and Longitude: 4°11`6.552) and S(Latitude: 7°39`18.312 and Longitude: 4°10`57.552) in Iwo town, Osun State, Southwest, Nigeria. To measure SAR values of each location, five different Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) were conducted randomly using a Schlumberger arrangement. IPWin2 computer software was used to analyse the data. Soil Samples (SS) of each VES station were taken and analysed at the Civil Engineering Laboratory. VES results showed that P, Q, R and S had different lithologies, SAR, depths, and Lowest Soil Apparent Resistivity Values (LSARV) ranging from 1.47-51.98Ωm. 40.40-73.60Ωm, 27.00-67.40Ωm, and 18.40-88.00Ωm while their respective depths were 2.06-26.40m, 7.13-11.8m, 9.65-11.60m, and 6.23-8.20m. LSARV of each location were attributed to the presence of conductive and moisture-rich minerals, which made the fault current cause the breaker/fuse to cut off, thereby safeguarding electrical appliances, animals, and humans. SS results indicated that P, Q, R, and S, on average, had 33.38%, 38.40%, 27.06%, and 29.68% SMC, respectively, which agrees with VES results. R2 values of SAR and SMC indicated ranges from 0.2357 to 0.7064. Thus, correlations between SAR and SMC values were established. This research has revealed ranges of SAR, depth and SMC that electrical engineers need for GSI.
