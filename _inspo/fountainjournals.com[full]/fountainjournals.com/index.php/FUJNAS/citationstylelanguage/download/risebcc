AB  - The minerals and nutritional values of leaves, fruits and seeds of many plants have been reported to vary, depending on factors like generic background, location, environmental and cultivation methods. Thus, phytochemical, proximate and mineral compositions of Gamelina arborea (G. aborea ) fruits from Kaduna state in North central part of Nigeria were assessed using standard analytical procedures. Qualitative phytochemical screening revealed that the fruit contained tarnnis, phenols, flavinods, saponins, reducing sugar and anthraquinones. The analysed G. aborea contained 7.30 % w/w ash, 5.00% w/w moisture, 5.31% w/w fat, 4.30% w/w fibre, 2.00% w/w protein and 75.00% w/w carbohydrate while its mineral compositions (mg/100g) were shown to contain Na (21.70±1.00); Ca (29.70 ±2.00), K (14.50±1.50), P (10.36±0.90), N (0.18±0.00), Cu (9.40±0.08), and Mn (21.70±1.00). Therefore, this finding accounts for the use of G. arborea as supplement for minerals in animal feeds.Keywords: Phytochemical, mineral composition, proximate composition, Gmelina arborea
