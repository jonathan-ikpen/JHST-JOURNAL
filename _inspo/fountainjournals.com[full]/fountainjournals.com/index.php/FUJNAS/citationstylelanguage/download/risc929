AB  - Variations in soil nutrients can influence the nutritional attributes of crops. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of varying sowing depths (2-8 cm) at 2 cm intervals on the nutritional contents of Luffa cylindrica (LC), Citrullus lanatus (CL) and Citrullus colocynthis (CC) fruits. Proximate, mineral and vitamin contents of seeds and pulps of fruits of the plants were determined. Protein (31.10±0.17 %), crude fibre (4.48±0.02 %), fat (47.13±0.27 %), ash (2.50±0.01 %) and carbohydrate (99.66±0.03 %) were higher (p
