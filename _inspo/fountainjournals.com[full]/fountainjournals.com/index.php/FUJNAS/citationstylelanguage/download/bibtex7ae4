This research presents a geochemical assessment of heavy metals in stream sediments from Oguro, Southwestern Nigeria, aimed at evaluating contamination levels and identifying potential sources. Twelve sediment samples were collected and analyzed for Cr, V, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Th, Zr, Mo, and Ti using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). A suite of geochemical indices—including the Geoaccumulation Index (I_geo), Contamination Factor (CF), Enrichment Factor (EF), and Pollution Load Index (PLI)—were employed alongside multivariate techniques. Results indicate that Cr, V, Ni, Th, and Zr are predominantly of lithogenic origin, whereas Cu, Zn, Pb, and Co show elevated spatial variability (CV > 96%) and enhanced I_geo (>12), CF (>3), and EF (>40), indicating strong anthropogenic inputs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ward-linkage hierarchical clustering identified two primary geochemical groupings: an anthropogenic cluster comprising transition and heavy metals, and a lithogenic–radiogenic assemblage. Despite low basin-wide PLI values (<0.5), metal concentrations at specific sites (e.g., L5 and L6) approach benchmark thresholds, highlighting areas of concern. The results provide a robust framework for environmental quality monitoring and inform management strategies for sediment quality in transitional agro-urban watersheds.
