The effects of organic nitrogen, sucrose and starch on the bio-methanation of rice bran were investigated using digesters of 1-litre capacity operated at ambient temperature (30- 32oC) and pH of 7 for 20 days. Rice bran and organic nitrogen supplement were varied at ratios 2:1, 3:1, 4:1 and 5:1, while 20g of sucrose and 20 g of starch were added to rice bran as supplements. Fresh strained cow rumen liquor was used as inoculum. There was no significant difference (P<0.05) between non-supplemented and sucrose supplemented feedstock. Starch supplemented feedstock produced more biogas than the sucrose supplemented and the non-supplemented feedstock (P>0.05). Varying the organic nitrogen had no significant effect on the biogas yield (P<0.05). Keywords: Inoculum; feedstock; sucrose; starch; poultry droppings
