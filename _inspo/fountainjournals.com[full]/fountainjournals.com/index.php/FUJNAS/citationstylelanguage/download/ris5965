AB  - Herbal medicine, deeply rooted in indigenous knowledge, presents a longstanding approach to global healthcare, particularly in Africa. This review comprehensively explores the holistic nature of Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM), with specific emphasis on the significance of herbal medicine. Despite its long-standing use and efficacy, herbal medicine faces challenges in universal acceptance and integration into mainstream healthcare systems. Factors influencing acceptance, from inadequate standardisation to societal stigma, are examined comprehensively. Understanding the motivations behind herbal medicine usage, including prevention, curiosity, and natural beliefs, is crucial for shaping future healthcare policies and comprehending public attitudes. Global initiatives, exemplified by the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine, and national endeavours in countries like Nigeria and Ghana, underscore collaborative approaches. The review concludes by emphasizing the necessity of addressing divergent stakeholder perspectives for effective integration. Proposed strategies involve collaborative research, international endorsements, adverse-event reporting systems, governmental support, inventorying, botanical gardens, testing laboratories, standardised dosage norms, and education initiatives. These measures aim to seamlessly integrate traditional medicine into mainstream healthcare, promote evidence-based practices, and enhance regulations—crucial steps toward fostering acceptance. Addressing challenges and fostering acceptance is imperative for ensuring the safe and effective utilisation of traditional medicines, thereby enhancing healthcare outcomes and overall well-being globally.Keywords: Herbal Remedies, Integrative Medicine, Traditional Medicine, Complementary Therapies
