The effect of inclusion of Jatropha curcas seed oil, as a source of oil in the feed of animal, on growth performance, hematological parameters and histology was investigated. Feed intake, average body weight gain and mortality were also monitored. Milled Jatropha curcas seeds were subjected to oil extraction using batch method. Hematological parameters were determined using standard operating procedures. Twenty weanling albino rats with mean weights ranging from 41.57± 7.90 g, were divided into two groups. The first group was placed on soybean oil-based (control) diet (4% oil) while the second group was placed on Jatropha curcas seed oil-based diet (4% oil), for four weeks. There was a significant higher difference (P<0.05) in the growth performance of rats fed the control diet when compared with the test group. The animals placed on the control diet showed significantly higher (P<0.05) body weight when compared with the test diet during the last week of experimentation and this might be due to the low digestibility of the Jatropha curcas seed oil-based diet. The result also shows a higher percentage mortality in the group fed the test diet when compared with those fed the control diet. Hematological parameters did not differ significantly (P>0.05) in both the control and test diets respectively but a significantly higher difference in neutrophils of those fed the control diet when compared with those fed test diet. This may signify that continuous ingestion of Jatropha curcas seed oil may reduce the body’s immunity against infections. The histological assessment of liver, kidney, heart and small intestine revealed no visible lesion. Overall, the result showed that Jatropha curcas seed oil has the potential of been a source of oil in animal diet if complete detoxification can be achieved.
