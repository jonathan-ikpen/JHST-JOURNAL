@article{Substrate Concentration and Thermal Effects During Polyhydroxyalkanoate Bioproduction_2022, volume={11}, url={https://fountainjournals.com/index.php/FUJNAS/article/view/415}, DOI={10.53704/fujnas.v11i1.415}, abstractNote={Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have long been thought to have the potential to replace petrochemical-based polymers because their production cost has been a challenging factor hindering their production processes. Previously characterized quantities of Micrococcus flavus SS21B screened for polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) were utilized. PHAs were then synthesized using corn cobs as a carbon source. Proximate analysis of corn cobs undertaken during this research reveals the presence of moisture and ash contents, crude fibre and protein, and carbohydrates. Optimization studies reveal an optimal PHA production at 8% substrate concentration and 37°C. This study shows that the carbon source has a more significant effect on the production of PHAs; i.e., the higher the carbon source in the production, the higher the PHAs synthesized, and the thermal effect required is average and not in excess.
