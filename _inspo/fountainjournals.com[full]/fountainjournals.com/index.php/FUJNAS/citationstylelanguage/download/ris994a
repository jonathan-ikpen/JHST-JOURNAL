AB  - Well-water samples were collected from the vicinity of Balogunâ€“biiro dump site located in Okebaale Osogbo, Osun state, Nigeria. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined qualitatively and quantitatively using GC-FID. The concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the water samples ranged from 0.01235 Âµg/kg to 0.05365 Âµg/kg with mean concentration ranging from 0.00094 Âµg/kg to 0.00335 Âµg/kg respectively. The highest concentration of âˆ‘16 ð‘ƒð´ð»ð‘  was recorded in S6 and it was observed that there is decline in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations from point of water pollution. There was a significant concentration of both the lower and higher rings polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the samples. These distributions as well as various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons diagnostic indices calculated showed that the sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the samples were both petrogenic and pyrogenic. The mean concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons recorded in the water samples showed a little bit enhanced values than the recommended tolerable limits, which indicated some level of pollution in the water samples.Keywords: PAHs, BOD, COD, Balogun-biiro, Dump-site
