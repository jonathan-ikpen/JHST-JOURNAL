AB  - The effect of inclusion of Jatropha curcas seed oil, as a source of oil in the feed of animal, on growth performance, hematological parameters and histology was investigated. Feed intake, average body weight gain and mortality were also monitored. Milled Jatropha curcas seeds were subjected to oil extraction using batch method. Hematological parameters were determined using standard operating procedures. Twenty weanling albino rats with mean weights ranging from 41.57± 7.90 g, were divided into two groups. The first group was placed on soybean oil-based (control) diet (4% oil) while the second group was placed on Jatropha curcas seed oil-based diet (4% oil), for four weeks. There was a significant higher difference (P
