This study evaluated the effect of aqueous extract of Senna occindentalis leaves on some biochemical parameters in Wistar rats. Twenty albino rats equally divided into four experimental groups were used. One group served as control and received the carrier solvent treatment. Three test groups were treated with S. occidentalis extract at 500, 1000 and 1500 mg/kg body weight respectively. The experiment lasted for 14 days after which the rats were sacrificed and blood collected for biochemical and haematological evaluation. Liver-body weight ratio was computed and liver histoarchitecture was investigated. The results showed that all haematological parameters were significantly (P<0.05) affected except the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular volume. There were also significant (P<0.05) alterations in the activities of gamma-glutamyl transferase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, as well as the levels of total protein, albumin and globulin in the serum. No significant (P>0.05) alterations were observed in the computed liver-body weight ratio but marked alterations in histoarchitecture of the liver cells were present. These alterations in the haematological parameters, liver function enzymes and histological evaluation suggest a selective toxicity of the extract on the animals.
