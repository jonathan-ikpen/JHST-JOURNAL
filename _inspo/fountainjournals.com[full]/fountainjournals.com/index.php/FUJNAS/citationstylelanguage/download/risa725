AB  - Social media has become part of students' lives with most undergraduates spending at least more than an hour on social media with various kinds of misuse including accessing adult materials. This study sought to determine the predictive powers of students' socio-demographic characteristics on involvement in risky sexual practices when using social media. The study was a cross-sectional descriptive survey including 400 undergraduates selected from the Departments of English Language and Education & History in the Ikire Campus; Community Medicine and Physiology in the Osogbo campus; and Animal Science and Agricultural Economics in the Ejigbo Campus through a multi-stage sampling procedure. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire consisting of five sections with both univariate and bivariate analyses conducted using the SPSS software version 20.0. The mean age of the respondents was 16.4±3.7years, 65.2% were female, 26.5% were 100L students, 95.5% were single, 93.5% belonged to the Yoruba ethnic group, and 67.0% were Christians. Similarly, 97.2% of the respondents had access to social media, and 87.8% accessed social media frequently.
