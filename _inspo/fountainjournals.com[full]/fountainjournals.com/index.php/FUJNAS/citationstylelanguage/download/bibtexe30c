Leaks in pipelines due to vandalism have always been a great concern due to loss of life, the implied risks and its associated costs. This has become even more critical with hazardous fluids that pose risk to life and the environment. In view of this, leak-detection systems play an important role in safeguarding pipeline operation by helping operators to quickly identify and react to spills. This paper aims to develop and demonstrate the use of an Intelligent Pipeline Vandalism Detection and Reporting System (IPVDRS) in detecting possible vandalism of petroleum pipelines in our environments. The system was developed using Visual Basic.NET technology. The system was able to interpret the readings of the remote sensors on the pipeline, detects compromise and trigger an alarm, creating the GPS coordinates of the triggered sensor on a map.
