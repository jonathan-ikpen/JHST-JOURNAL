AB  - Ascorbic acid is an essential vitamin derived from fruits and vegetables for human growth. This study investigated the ascorbic acid contents of juice extracts and its rate of loss in fresh fruits and stored fruits, specifically pineapple, water melon, grape and orange. Fruits were extracted by electric juice extractor, and each fruit juice extracted was divided to two groups. The First group were refrigerated in PET and glass bottle at -4 º C for one month While the second group were stored at room temperature with and without preservative (sodium benzoate). Commercial fruit juices commonly sold in the market were also refrigerated at - 4 º C for 13 days. The physical parameters (Brix and pH) were determined on each of the fresh fruit juices using a refractometer and pH metre. The general outcome of this study revealed that the rate at which ascorbic acid is lost during storage depends on the type of fruit, storage condition and duration of storage.Keywords: Ascorbic acid, Fruit, Juice storage, Iodometry
