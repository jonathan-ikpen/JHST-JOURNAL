        Responsibilities of Reviewers
      </h2>
      <p>
        The essence of the peer review process is to assist the editor and the
        editorial board in making a publishing decision and also assist the
        author in improving the quality of their work by providing critical
        feedback. With this, the reviews’ responsibilities are highlighted
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Any information regarding the
          submitted manuscript should be strictly kept confidential and
          shouldn’t be discussed with a third party without the permission of
          the editor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Conflict of interest:</strong> If any of the reviewers have a
          conflict of interest in any manuscript resulting from a collaboration,
          competition, or any other connection with any of the authors,
          companies, or institutions connected to the papers, the reviewer
          should not consider the manuscript.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unbiasedness:</strong> The reviewers should consider the
          manuscript objectively without any consideration of the authors’ race,
          religion, ethnicity, political affiliation, age, or whatsoever.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Objectivity:</strong> The assessment by the reviewers should
          be conducted objectively, supported with data and the arguments should
          be clearly expressed without personal criticism of any of the authors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Celerity:</strong> The review should be conducted promptly as
          stipulated by the editor and if a potential reviewer feels unqualified
          to assess the manuscript, he/she should withdraw from the review
          process and notify the editor immediately for a timely replacement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Acknowledgement of sources and relevant works:</strong> The
          reviewers must make sure that the authors have acknowledged and cited

        Statement of Human and Animal Rights
      </h2>
      <p>
        When reporting experiments on human subjects, authors should indicate
        whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical
        standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation
        (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975,
        as revised in 2000. If doubt exists whether the research was conducted
        in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, the authors must explain
        the rationale for their approach, and demonstrate that the institutional
        review body explicitly approved the doubtful aspects of the study. When
        reporting experiments on animals, authors should be asked to indicate
        whether the institutional and national guide for the care and use of
        laboratory animals was followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors of manuscripts that describe experimental studies on either
        humans or animals must supply a statement that the study was approved by
        an institutional review committee or ethics committee and that the
        subjects gave informed consent. Such approval should be described in the
        Methods section of the manuscript. In addition, for studies conducted
        with human subjects, the method by which informed consent was obtained
        from the participants (i.e., verbal or written) also needs to be stated
        in the Methods section.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-4 my-4">
        <p>
          For studies with human subjects, please include the following

        Research involving human participants, their data or biological material
      </h3>

      <h4 class="font-bold mt-4">Ethics approval</h4>
      <p>
        When reporting a study that involved human participants, their data or
        biological material, authors should include a statement that confirms
        that the study was approved (or granted exemption) by the appropriate
        institutional and/or national research ethics committee (including the
        name of the ethics committee) and certify that the study was performed
        in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the
        <a href="#" class="text-primary hover:underline"
          >1964 Declaration of Helsinki</a
        >
        and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-bold mt-4">Retrospective ethics approval</h4>
      <p>
        If a study has not been granted ethics committee approval prior to
        commencing, retrospective ethics approval usually cannot be obtained and
        it may not be possible to consider the manuscript for peer review. The
        decision on whether to proceed to peer review in such cases is at the
        Editor's discretion.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-bold mt-4">Ethics approval for retrospective studies</h4>
      <p>
        Although retrospective studies are conducted on already available data
        or biological material (for which formal consent may not be needed or is
        difficult to obtain) ethics approval may be required depending on the
        law and the national ethical guidelines of a country.
      </p>

      <h4 class="font-bold mt-4">Ethics approval for case studies</h4>
      <p>
        Case reports require ethics approval. Most institutions will have
        specific policies on this subject. Authors should check with their
        institution to make sure they are complying with the specific
        requirements of their institution and seek ethics approval where needed.

        Procedures for Dealing with Unethical Behavior
      </h2>

      <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Identification</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Unethical behaviour can be identified and reported to journal editors
          and/or the publisher at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unethical practices may include but are not limited to, violations of
          any of the above-mentioned Ethical Expectations (e.g., plagiarism,
          falsification or fabrication, authorship falsification, redundant
          publication, undeclared conflict of interest, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          For an investigation to be conducted, the person reporting the ethical
          breach must provide sufficient evidence. Until a conclusion is
          reached, all allegations are treated equally and seriously.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Investigation</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          The journal's editor will investigate not usually alone but in
          consultation with JHST.
        </li>
        <li>
          To avoid defamation, evidence gathering will be done so that
          allegations are only shared with those who need to know.
        </li>
        <li>
          The investigation will be completed within a reasonable time after the
          allegation is made.
        </li>
        <li>
          The accused party will be notified and allowed to respond to the
          allegation as part of the investigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the allegation(s) are valid as part of the investigation, the
          severity of the breach will be determined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cases beyond the editor's investigative capabilities (e.g., data
          fabrication or theft) will be referred to the author's institution
          with a request for an investigation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Consequences</h3>
      <p>
        When an ethical violation is confirmed, one or more of the following
        actions will be taken:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>

        <li>
          Sending a strongly worded letter to the author or reviewer outlining
          the breach and warning against future behaviour;

      <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Conflict of Interest</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          All authors must disclose any commercial associations or other
          arrangements (e.g., financial compensation received, patient-licensing
          arrangements, the potential for profit, consultancy, stock ownership,
          etc.) that may pose a conflict of interest in connection with the
          article.
        </li>
        <li>
          Editors and reviewers must recuse themselves from evaluating papers in
          which they may have a conflict of interest.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Appeals</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Authors have the right to appeal decisions. All appeals will be
          reviewed on a case-by-case basis by journal editors. The journal
          editors will recuse themselves depending on the nature of the appeal,
          and the appeal will be reviewed by a different member of the journal's
          editorial team.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Corrections</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          Authors must notify the journal's editor of any factual errors they
          discover or are informed of in a published article. When corrections
          are required, they are made quickly and are accompanied by an errata
          notice that describes the correction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Retractions</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
        <li>
          The editors consider retractions when there is evidence of
          untrustworthy data or findings, plagiarism, duplicate publication, or
          unethical research. If an article is under investigation, we may
          consider an expression of concern notice. If it is determined that a
          retraction is required, a retraction notice will be added, along with
          an explanation of the retraction and the original article metadata.
          The original text will still be available.
        </li>
        <li>
          In exceptional circumstances, the original article may be removed for
          legal reasons. In such cases, the metadata will be kept, while the
          original text will be replaced with the retraction note and a note
          explaining why the article was removed for legal reasons.
